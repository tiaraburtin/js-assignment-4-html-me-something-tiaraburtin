   <p>Fertile Land Garden was founded on Feburary 25, 2022.
      The purpose of the organization is to provide holistic alternatives for the
      community to encourage self empowerment, self sustainabilty, and self determination.
      The garden was founded by Tara Blanchard and Tiara Burtin, two herbalist and
      medicine women. The mission of Fertile Land is to teach the community through
      womb wellness ceremonies, ancestral veneration, and somatic practices.<br><br>

      In the last year, the organization spent time developing the garden by having
      garden beds built through the construction class at North County Technical Highchool.
      The garden hosted community service projects, yoga classes, and extended a gardening
      class for middle school girls.<br><br>


      The inspiration for the project was a result of the growing food deserts in
      St. Louis, Missouri. Aside from low access to food, community members did not have
      access to stress management resources or alternative healing remedies.

         <em>For The Sake Of All</em></a>, a study done by Washington University in St. Louis,
      showed that most deaths in the Black population in St. Louis where a result of
      food access, stress related disorders, and lack of exercises. <br><br>

      Fertile Land Garden is a response to the needs of the community. Folks should not
      have to travel outside of their community to reach resources needed to live, thrive,
      and grow.<br><br></p>
